# thesios
Thesios is an app that allows both students and teachers to manage and keep an overview of the thesis submission workflow. Done as part of a university project.
It is built in React Native. If you wish to test the app, download the code, run npm install and after that, in the console, you must type in "expo start" and it will fire up a server on your local machine.
